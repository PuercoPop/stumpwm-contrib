* Commentary
  Window tags are special window properties stored in X11 window properties
  that can be used for window manipulations.

  +They can survive temporary WM change+.

  They allow more flexible classification of windows than selecting window
  groups for them.

  They are stored as a list of strings separated by a Record Separated (#\Rs –
  ASCII code 30).
